I designed and developed a simple Weather Information Web Page named WeatherWiz using pure HTML. The project displays weather-related information such as temperature, weather conditions, and location details in a clean and structured layout.

The main goal of the project was to practice my HTML skills and create a functional static webpage that showcases how weather data can be presented to users in a user-friendly way. I used various HTML tags such as headings, paragraphs, tables, and divisions to arrange the content neatly on the page.

The page contains sections like:

Header: Project name and basic introduction
Main Content: A weather report table with sample data (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.)
Footer: A simple note or credits section
The design is kept minimal and responsive, focusing on semantic HTML and clean structure without adding CSS or JavaScript (if not required).

Through this project, I strengthened my knowledge of:

HTML tags and elements
Semantic structuring of web pages
Basic formatting and layout creation
Working with tables for structured data
